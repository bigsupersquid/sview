Using 
http://androidblog.reindustries.com/a-real-opengl-es-2-0-2d-tutorial-part-2/
as a base, modified to shwo fullscreen image, along with an adaptation of the interlaced OpenGLES shaders from
https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/tree/master/samples/StereoscopicRendering/assets/shaders
simple proof-of-concept OpenGLES shader rendering of HTC Evo 3d compatible interlacing
Displays a side-by-side image as an interlaced stereo image, and sets the 3d mode to match device orientation
Does not handle advanced functionality like display ratio, choosing images, etc, 
it is just a skeleton to show the working model.
